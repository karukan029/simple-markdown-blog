# Minimalist Design Principles for Modern Websites

Minimalism in web design is more than just an aesthetic choice—it's a functional approach that enhances user experience by removing unnecessary elements and focusing on what truly matters.

## Core Principles of Minimalist Design

### 1. Simplicity

Keep interfaces clean and straightforward. Remove unnecessary elements and focus on what's essential.

### 2. White Space

Don't be afraid of empty space. It helps create balance and draws attention to important elements.

### 3. Typography

Choose readable fonts and establish a clear hierarchy with a limited number of font sizes.

### 4. Limited Color Palette

Use a restricted color palette with 2-3 primary colors and accent colors for highlighting important elements.

## Example CSS for Minimalist Design

```css
/* Example of minimalist styling */
body {
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.6;
  color: #333;
  background-color: #fff;
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 2rem;
}

h1, h2, h3 {
  font-weight: 700;
  line-height: 1.2;
}

button {
  background-color: #000;
  color: #fff;
  border: none;
  padding: 0.75rem 1.5rem;
  font-size: 1rem;
