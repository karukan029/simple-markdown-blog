## Building Your First Component

Here's a simple Next.js component:

```jsx
// pages/index.js
import Head from 'next/head'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>My Next.js App</title>
      </Head>
      <main>
        <h1>Welcome to Next.js!</h1>
      </main>
